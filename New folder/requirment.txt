As cheaply as possible, produce a centralized system which efficiently manages the movement of two elevators in a 6 story building.
The attached 3rd party API contains two Interfaces and a Factory used to remotely interact with the hardware.
This software will need to support the following user activities;
       Press Button to request a lift go up,
       Press Button request lift to go down,
       Press Button to stop lift,
       6 Buttons to select the 6 floors.
The software needs to support a web page that allows a remote security team to know the status of the two elevators. (e.g. lift 4 is moving up to level 3.)
You will need to provide a similar API that can be used to receive button press events, such that they can be provided to the hardware company to communicate with your software.
Include a short detail about your approach and design, and how you ensure this is developed with minimum cost.
This task will be used to validate ability to code within the following constraints / requirements;
       Maven build
       Utilize Spring framework
       REST API's
       Apache httpd
       Apache Tomcat
       JSP Templates
